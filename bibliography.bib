	abstract = {Trauma is a major global health burden with long-term consequences to patients. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly being recognized and utilised to improve trauma care. It is imperative to identify the PROs that are most relevant, applicable, and suitable to a context. However, there is limited research on PROs in trauma care in low- and middle-income countries, like India, that bear a disproportionate burden of global trauma. This paper aims to examine PROs considered to be most relevant for trauma patients after discharge in the context of urban India.
We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews of 11 adult post discharge trauma patients, across demographic and injury groups, and two persons working with trauma patients from five tertiary-care public hospitals in the Indian cities of Mumbai and Kolkata. We performed thematic analysis to identify themes within the participants responses on PROs important to them based on their experiences.
Four themes emerged in the analysis of the participant interviews. The need for full physical functioning, the need to address psychological consequences, the need to alleviate economic cost of trauma, and the need for social interactions. Outcomes related to these themes were most relevant to the participants.
The findings of this paper can help researchers and clinicians select appropriate PROs, based on the four themes, for trauma research and to improve trauma care in urban India. Future research should focus on PROs relevant to specific demographic and injury groups in India and other LMICs.},

	abstract = {Background: Due to complex geography and resource constraints, trauma patients are often initially transported to community or rural facilities rather than a larger Level I or II trauma center. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesize evidence on interventions that improved the quality of trauma care and/or reduced healthcare costs at non-Level I or II facilities.
Methods: A scoping review was performed to identify studies implementing a Quality Improvement (QI) initiative at a non-major trauma center (i.e., non-Level I or II trauma center [or equivalent]). We searched 3 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) and the grey literature (relevant networks, organizations/associations). Methodological quality was evaluated using NIH and JBI study quality assessment tools. Studies were included if they evaluated the effect of implementing a trauma care QI initiative on one or more of the following: 1) trauma outcomes (mortality, morbidity); 2) system outcomes (e.g., length of stay [LOS], transfer times, provider factors); 3) provider knowledge or perception; or 4) healthcare costs. Pediatric trauma, pre-hospital and tele-trauma specific studies were excluded.
Results: Of 1046 data sources screened, 36 were included for full review (29 journal articles, 7 abstracts/posters without full text). Educational initiatives including the Rural Trauma Team Development Course and the Advanced Trauma Life Support course were the most common QI interventions investigated. Study outcomes included process metrics such as transfer time to tertiary care and hospital LOS, along with measures of provider perception and knowledge. Improvement in mortality was reported in a single study evaluating the impact of establishing a dedicated trauma service at a community hospital.
Conclusions: Our review captured a broad spectrum of trauma QI projects implemented at non-major trauma centers. Educational interventions did result in process outcome improvements and high rates of self-reported improvements in trauma care. Given the heterogeneous capabilities of community and rural hospitals, there is no panacea for trauma QI at these facilities. Future research should focus on patient outcomes like mortality and morbidity, and locally relevant initiatives.},

This study aimed to develop the Indian 5-level version EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) value set, which is a key input in health technology assessment for resource allocation in healthcare.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey using the EuroQol Group’s Valuation Technology was undertaken in a representative sample of 3548 adult respondents, selected from 5 different states of India using a multistage stratified random sampling technique. The participants were interviewed using a computer-assisted personal interviewing technique. This study adopted a novel extended EuroQol Group’s Valuation Technology design that included 18 blocks of 10 composite time trade-off (c-TTO) tasks, comprising 150 unique health states, and 36 blocks of 7 discrete choice experiment (DCE) tasks, comprising 252 DCE pairs. Different models were explored for their predictive performance. Hybrid modeling approach using both c-TTO and DCE data was used to estimate the value set.
Results
A total of 2409 interviews were included in the analysis. The hybrid heteroscedastic model with censoring at −1 combining c-TTO and DCE data yielded the most consistent results and was used for the generation of the value set. The predicted values for all 3125 health states ranged from −0.923 to 1. The preference values were most affected by the pain/discomfort dimension.
Conclusions
This is the largest EQ-5D-5L valuation study conducted so far in the world. The Indian EQ-5D-5L value set will promote the effective conduct of health technology assessment studies in India, thereby generating credible evidence for efficient resource use in healthcare.},

	abstract = {Background, Trauma remains a leading global cause of mortality, particularly in low-resource settings. Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) training offers a standardized approach to trauma care, yet its impact in India remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ATLS training in reducing preventable trauma-related deaths and improving clinical decision-making at a tertiary care center in Bihar, India., Methods, This mixed-methods cohort study was conducted from October 2021 to December 2024 and included 200 trauma patients aged ≥18 years. Patients were divided into two groups: pre-ATLS (retrospective; October 2021 to July 2024) and post-ATLS (prospective; August 2024 to December 2024). Mortality rates, trauma management errors, and survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, chi-square tests, logistic regression models, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Additionally, structured interviews with healthcare providers supplemented the quantitative findings. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R software, Version 4.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with significance set at p {\textless} 0.05., Results, ATLS training significantly reduced preventable deaths (from 30\% to 15\%) and potentially preventable deaths (from 40\% to 25\%). Trauma management errors, including delayed diagnoses and protocol deviations, also decreased post-training. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated improved survival, while Cox regression identified ATLS training as an independent predictor of survival (HR = 0.62, 95\% CI: 0.45-0.85, p = 0.003). Healthcare providers reported greater confidence in trauma assessment but highlighted concerns regarding accessibility, cost, and the need for refresher courses., Conclusions, ATLS training enhances trauma care by reducing preventable mortality, minimizing errors, and boosting provider confidence. Expanding ATLS programs, particularly in resource-limited settings, is recommended. Future research should focus on long-term patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of ATLS implementation.},

	abstract = {Background We assessed the impact of rural trauma team development course (RTTDC) on clinical processes and patient outcomes of motorcycle-accident-related neurological and/or musculoskeletal injuries in selected Ugandan hospitals.
Methods Trial design: Two-arm, parallel, multi-period, cluster-randomized controlled trial.Participants: Trauma care frontliners, and patients aged 2-80 years at three intervention and three control Ugandan hospitals (1:1 allocation).Randomization: Hospitals were randomly allocated to intervention or control using permuted block sequences.Blinding: Patient-participants and outcome assessors were blind to allocation. Intervention arm: 500 trauma care frontliners received RTTDC; patients received standard care.Control arm: Patients received standard care without RTTDC for staff.Primary outcomes: Time from accident to admission and from referral to discharge.Secondary outcomes: 90-day mortality and morbidity related to neurological and/or musculoskeletal injuries.We followed the CONSORT guidelines for cluster randomized trials.
Results We analyzed 1003 participants (501 intervention, 502 control). The intervention arm had a shorter median prehospital time (1hr; IQR=0·50-2·00) and referral to discharge interval (median 2hrs; IQR=1·25-2·75) vs. [(2hrs; IQR=1·50-4·00) mean difference 1·13hrs, p{\textless}0·0001 and (4hrs; IQR=2·50-4·10), mean difference 1·39hrs, p{\textless}0·0001 in the control], respectively. The 90-day mortality was more than halved in the intervention (5\%, 24/457) vs. (13\%, 58/430) in the control arm (p{\textless}0·0001). Fewer participants in the intervention group had unfavorable Glasgow Outcome Scale scores (9\%, 42/457) vs. (20\%, 87/430), p{\textless}0·0001. No difference was found in musculoskeletal injury morbidity outcomes (p=0·567).
Interpretation Rural trauma team development training improved organizational time efficiency and clinical outcomes for neurological injuries without negatively impacting musculoskeletal injury morbidity outcomes.

Evidence before this study Understaffing and injury-related mortality are highest in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where trauma education and training opportunities are scarce.Observational studies in the US suggest that rural trauma team development training can improve clinician knowledge and reduce pre-hospital intervals.However, there are no prospective, randomized controlled trials that have assessed the translation of this knowledge and training into clinical practice affecting patient outcomes in LMICs.Added value of this study In a multi-center, cluster-randomized controlled trial, we investigated the impact of rural trauma team development, training and coordination on pre- and intra-hospital intervals, and outcomes for neurological and musculoskeletal injuries in an African low-resource setting.Results showed a reduction in prehospital time and all-cause mortality by more than half, without worsening patient-reported trauma morbidity.Implications of all the available evidence Prognostic level II evidence from this trial supports that locally contextualized, trainee-led rural trauma team development interventional programs are feasible and improve clinical processes and patient outcomes in LMICs.},
