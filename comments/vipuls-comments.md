Respected sir, 

I am sorry for late reply, I could not attend the meeting on 13 Feb as I was busy with an emergency Surgery.
 
I had gone through the manuscript and found the following points as stated below.
I had replied to the email received on 12 February. 

This is overall a well drafted manuscript. Team has taken utmost care to include all the minute details. I would like to bring some points to your notice

 1.       Is there a way where we can correlate mortality with the severity of injury, or whether it was preventable or non-preventable --- it will help to compare data within the study arm and control arm. Also the cause of mortality within 30 days was related to trauma or not?
2.       How do we comment or assess the care given in these centres in the next 30 days after the trauma? Or Care taken at home after discharge?
3.       Recording data during designated shifts – might be a possibility that during that shift the number of presenting patients were less – might be a cause of less than expected rate of enrolment of patients. Or on the selected unit days the number of patients presenting will be less compared to other days. We can take this into consideration while designing the further study protocol.
4.       Also the study shows the confidence level of residents was 10/10 before and after training – can we add something relating to the benefit from the training received – to stress on the advantages of training? Or was there a change in outlook towards management of trauma patients after training?



For your consideration and opinion.
