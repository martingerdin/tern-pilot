# Lab book for the TERN pilot publication

This file includes code and scripts used to experiment and explore with the TERN pilot data. 

## Generate synthetic data

Because developing on the server is generally slow, a first step to speed up development was to generate a synthetic dataset that could be safely used locally. 

```{r, synthetic-data-generation}
install.packages("synthpop")
codebook.syn(data) 

```
